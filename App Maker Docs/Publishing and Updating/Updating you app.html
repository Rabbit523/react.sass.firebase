<p>We have live updates together with EXPO OTA (Over The Air ) updates.</p><p>So. you will need to submit a new build only if you have a new App name.&nbsp; App Icon or App Splash.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything&nbsp;else is manageable from our panel.</p><p>To submit a&nbsp;new version - change app name, icon or splash. Go in the Submit&nbsp;screen and submit the app for compiling once again..&nbsp;</p>
